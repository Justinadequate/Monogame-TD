# Monogame-TD

My second attempt at a game project using a low-level framework. For this project I wanted to make a simple top-down tower defense game to practice enemy/tower behavior as well as rudimentary AABB collision. I also took this opportunity to apply what I learned from my previous experiences with Monogame and my brief stint with Unity engine to improve on my last attempt. To run, you will need to have the Monogame 3.8 / .NET 6 runtimes installed, then run `dotnet build` -> `dotnet run` in the root directory.

In the future, I would like to implement a proper pathfinding system for enemies, as the current iteration works with basic rectangle collision checks against ground tiles that tell the enemy monster which direction to walk. After that, working on a UI system that allows a player to set structures on specific tiles, and then tower behavior including targeting based on player-set preference.
